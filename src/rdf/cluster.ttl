                             in electro-magnetic media. We propose an exploratory method that reveals a robust
                             clustering hierarchy. Our approach uses the Delaunay diagram to incorporate spatial
                             proximity. It does not require any prior knowledge about the data set, nor does it require
                             parameters from the user. Multi-level clusters are successfully discovered by this new
                             method in only O(nlogn) time, where n is the size of the data set. The efficiency of our
                             methods allows us to construct and display a new type of tree graph that facilitates
                             understanding of the complex hierarchy of clusters. We show that clustering methods that
                             adopt a raster-like or vector-like representation of proximity are not appropriate for spatial
                             clustering. We conduct an experimental evaluation with synthetic data sets as well as real
                             data sets to illustrate the robustness of our method.""".

                             Normally, this algorithm can automatically discover clusters of complicated shapes, and non-homoge-
