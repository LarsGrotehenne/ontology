                             clustering hierarchy. Our approach uses the Delaunay diagram to incorporate spatial
                             proximity. It does not require any prior knowledge about the data set, nor does it require
                             parameters from the user. Multi-level clusters are successfully discovered by this new
                             method in only O(nlogn) time, where n is the size of the data set. The efficiency of our

            dc:description  """Clustering data by identifying a subset of representative examples is important
                            for processing sensory signals and detecting patterns in data.
                            Such “exemplars” can be found by randomly choosing an initial subset
                            of data points and then iteratively refining it, but this works well
                            only if that initial choice is close to a good solution. We devised a
                            method called “affinity propagation,” which takes as input measures of
                            similarity between pairs of data points. Real-valued messages are exchanged
                            between data points until a high-quality set of exemplars and corresponding
                            clusters gradually emerges. We used affinity propagation to cluster images of
                            faces, detect genes in microarray data, identify representative sentences in
                            this manuscript, and identify cities that are efficiently accessed by airline
                            travel. Affinity propagation found clusters with much lower error than other
                            methods, and it did so in less than one-hundredth the amount of time.""".

            dc:description  """A method for determining the mutual nearest neighbours (MNN) and
                            mutual neighbourhood value (mnv) of a sample point, using the conventional
                            nearest neighbours, is suggested. A nonparametric, hierarchical,
                            agglomerative clustering algorithm is developed using the above concepts.
                            The algorithm is simple, deterministic, noniterative, requires low storage
                            and is able to discern spherical and nonspherical clusters. The method is
                            applicable to a wide class of data of arbitrary shape, large size and high
                            dimensionality. The algorithm can discern mutually homogenous clusters.
                            Strong or weak patterns can be discerned by properly choosing the neighbourhood width.""".
